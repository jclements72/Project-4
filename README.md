# Project-4

Project objectives:

Gather datasets based on new cancer rates and cancer mortality rates for high population states
Create model to predict new cancer rates and cancer mortality for whole united states
Display actual and prediction results on map using tableau, also displaying demographics like income, insurance rates, population, race, poverty

Project questions:

What demographics affect new cancer cases the most, are they the same as cancer mortality?

Which states are at the greatest risks?
