This repository contains an ML project that takes in demographics information like population, poverty rates, and income and produces cancer case numbers and death numbers for an area. The repository includes the resources and csvs used to conduct the project as well as several jupyter notebook scripts that combines the data and ultimately create the ML model. The repo also contains a slide deck that presents the results found. 

Overall the project was a success as an accurate model was made and was able to reproduce similar results to the actual case numbers and death numbers. This was also the case when the model was given new information not used in the production of the model. We conclude that lineaer regression and multiple linear regression can be used to produce predictions for cancer cases numbers. But should utlimately be used for finding areas that may be at risk based on the demographics given rather than just predicting case numbers.
